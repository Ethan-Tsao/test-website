# Ethan Tsao's Website

## Description

This is a personal website that will include everything I create from videos to pictures to programs and websites. I have a wide breadth of interests so this is my outlet.

## Technologies

This website uses Next.js and Chakra-UI. This will eventually be deployed to AWS S3 as a static website. If there ever comes a time when I decide to create a backend, then I will refactor this website and move to AWS EC2 with S3 storage.
